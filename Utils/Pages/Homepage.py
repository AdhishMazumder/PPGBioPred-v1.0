                This web server provides a machine learning model for predicting the bioactivity of drugs against 
                PPARγ. PPARγ is an important target for drug discovery, and this model can 
                be used to identify new drug candidates for a variety of diseases, including osteoporosis, cancer, and 
                Alzheimer's disease. This web server is a valuable resource for drug discovery researchers and clinicians. 
                It can be used to identify new drug candidates for a variety of diseases, and it can also be used to 
                predict the bioactivity of existing drugs. 
                </h6>
                <h6 style='text-align: justify; color: black;font-weight: normal;'>
                The server is built using classification and regression models, trained on the most recent dataset 
                obtained from the 
                ChEMBL database, and it can predict the bioactivity of new drugs based on the trained model. 
                To use the model, simply submit the structure of a chemical structure of the drug of your choice
                in the SMILES notation and the model will predict its bioactivity against PPARγ. Upon finishing,
                the server will display the bioactivity values obtained by it.

                <h6 style='text-align: justify; color: black;font-weight: normal;'>
                We hope that this web server will be a valuable tool for the 
                scientific community, and we are committed to keeping it up-to-date with the latest advances in machine 
                learning and drug discovery.
